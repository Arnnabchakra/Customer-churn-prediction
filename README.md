# Customer-churn-prediction
"Customer churn prediction is like foreseeing when customers might stop using a service. It's important for businesses to prevent this by using computer analysis and smart tools. They look at how customers use a service, how much they buy, and if they have any problems. By doing this, businesses can figure out who might leave and take steps to keep them happy. This helps the business keep its money, use resources better, and make customers happier. They use computer programs to guess who might leave, based on how customers act. This way, businesses can keep customers and stay ahead of others. 
# Problem Statement!
"Create a predictive model to anticipate customer churn by analyzing historical data on interactions and demographics. Process and select pertinent features using machine learning algorithms. Train the model, emphasizing interpretability, and evaluate its effectiveness."
# About Dataset
"Here's a brief overview of the types of data you might find in a credit card churn prediction dataset like Customer ID, Age, Surname, Credit Score, Gender, Tenure, Balance, Estimated Salary."
# Algorithms Used
"ANN (Artificial Neural Network)"
# Accuracy
"ANN Accuracy â€“ 79%
# Conclusion
"In conclusion, customer churn prediction is a crucial task for businesses, especially in industries such as credit cards. By leveraging diverse datasets encompassing demographic information, transaction history, and customer interactions, machine learning models can effectively forecast potential churn. Models like logistic regression, decision trees, or neural networks prove instrumental in capturing intricate patterns within the data. Interpretability and continuous improvement mechanisms are essential for practical deployment, enabling timely intervention and customer retention strategies. Ultimately, a well-documented and insightful churn prediction model empowers businesses to proactively address customer attrition, optimize operations, and enhance overall customer satisfaction and loyalty."
